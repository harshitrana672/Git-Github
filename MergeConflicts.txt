To commit and add a tracked file simultaneously in one command use 
git commit -a -m "Updateed Index"
This command won't work if there is a untracked file present 

if you want to create a branch and switch to that new branch simultaneously 
use 
git checkout -b heading 

Command git branch -v gives us the detail about the branch and commit happend to them recently 

git branch -r is used to know the detail of all remote branch 
So MERGE conflict is basically lets take an exmple we have two branch one is main and other is heading so if in both branch one file is edited 
and the same line is edited so at the time of merging them which one to keep 
To resolve this issue you get a option in your editor (vscode) to accept which change and then complete merge 

to know which branch merged currently use this command 
git branch --merged 

to know which branch are not currently merged 
use this command 
git branch --no-merged

so now if you didn't merged a particular branch and you want to delte that branch doing this 
git branch -d filter 
didn't work it gives you warning that this is not merged to forcefully delete this branch use 
git branch -D filter 

git push -u origin main this -u here is to create a upstream so you can directly pull those change that maded online 
ALWAYS PULL BEFORE YOU PUSH
