why we need multiple branch 
so in order to work on different feature of same project which took time and we need to commit daily , we can't do that regularly on main branch 
so we create another branch and do separte testing for that features and when things got done we merge it back to main branch 
so now how to create a branch use this command 

git branch name-of-the-branch
to check how much branch you have  git branch , for switching to other branch apart from main use this command 
git checkout name-of-the-branch

Now every commit you make will commit to this branch
git push origin feature-button
now to switch back to main branch use 
git checkout main
now to merge the feature back to main branch you need first get to that branch here is our main 
now use this command
git merge feature-button 
now after mergin the branch you need to push those change to the main branch also so do the psuh to main branch 

Now the feature is complete and i don't want that branch anymore so I can delete it to do that we use 
git branch -d feautre-button
but this is happened locally so you need to push it again to main 

now this branch is deleted locally but still present on online repository 
to delete from their as well use 
git push origin --delete feature-button 

So now we are creating a new branch withe name search and adding new page into it and  commit 2 changes but before merging the branch to the main branch we done another commit on the main branch and we want that change to reflect on our newly created branch so here the concept of git pulll comes into picture 

so basically the branch you are on here is search can pull the change happend to main branch using this command 
git pull origin main 
then we can merge them remember when you're pulling your change make sure youre on search branch 
then use git merge search but by switching to main again 

Now here the concept is you are trying to make changes but before you pushing it to the remote repository someone already push something to it or another team member 
in this case you need to pull those changes first that is present on your main branch
