git squash its a technique helps us to combine mutliple commit 
so basically git squash is when we did commit multiple changes but we want to combine them in a single commit so it can't be visible online 
we combine them using git squash so to do that we need to follow some steps as follows:
first use this command 
git rebase -i HEAD~4 (4 is no of commit you want to combine this command open up a interactive unix shell so it showing some option if we choose
pick that means commit and if we choose squash that will be merged so in front of written commit insert squash for them you want to merge

then press ESC and enter :X and then enter 
then it is asked for recent commit message then press ESC then enter then :x then enter 

git revert 
With the term revert or reverse we are going to reverse certain things 
the aim is to revert the change for a particular commit 
So to revert the commit change we can do that using commit id or by the complete hash id and also by using head with the position also ex
head 0 head 1 and so on ..
So now using this command 
git revert HEAD~2 it will revert the change happend in Head 2 position from the head 0 commit 

git reset 
so it basically you accidently or by knowlingly pushes file to commit stage and you don't want the commit but want the change precisely said
the change should present in stagging area then you can use git reset 
command
git reset --soft HEAD~ for head 0 commit 
or git reset --soft commitiD 

git reset is for moving the change from stagging area to working directory 
by default the command is 
git reset 

with hard reset the changes is also gone along with commit 
to use this we need to use 
git reset --hard HEAD~

by doing hard reset we simply remove all the further commit fromt that particular commit
