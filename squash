git squash its a technique helps us to combine mutliple commit 
so basically git squash is when we did commit multiple changes but we want to combine them in a single commit so it can't be visible online 
we combine them using git squash so to do that we need to follow some steps as follows:
first use this command 
git rebase -i HEAD~4 (4 is no of commit you want to combine this command open up a interactive unix shell so it showing some option if we choose
pick that means commit and if we choose squash that will be merged so in front of written commit insert squash for them you want to merge

then press ESC and enter :X and then enter 
then it is asked for recent commit message then press ESC then enter then :x then enter
