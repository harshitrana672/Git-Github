git tag 
this helps to mark a point in git history or reposiotry history that this point is dedicated for this particular tag 
so after any commit we can add tag just by using 
git tag v0.1  (v0.1 is the tag name )
then after every commit it can't be displayed on your remote repository untill you push it to that  by using 
git push v0.1 
you can check all the tags using git tag --list
Also after creating you can release all things just by goint to create new release and then choosing tag version and publishing 

now here we are going to create a new tag v0.2

git checkout 
if i create multiple tag and release and i want to checkout the previous version of my application I need to visit to that particular commit of that tag 
so git checkout not only works with branches but you can switch to tags as well by just providing the tag name ex, 
git checkout v0.1

not only that you can visit to any particular commit using git checkout commitID if any commit happen after that v0.1 it will create a new timeline and chance 
are it will destroy the whole timeline 

if i want to delete any tag 
git tag -d tagname (v0.3) if we want to delete it locally if you wan to delete it from remote also you need to follow similar previous commmand 

to delete the already present origin and creating your own origin you need to do 
git remote rm origin 
to clone any project use git clone linkoftheproject
add your own repository to this current project using git remote add origin linkofyourrepository 
then to upstream git push -u origin main
